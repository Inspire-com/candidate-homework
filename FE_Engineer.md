The objective of this exercise is to build a small javascript-based web application using javascript, html and css. The application should retrieve json-formatted data using the following endpoint:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/api-fun/books.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/api-fun/books.json)

The application requirements are as follows:

- Display the author's name, birthday and place of birth followed by a list of books.
- On a desktop view, the list of books should appear in two columns with 5 books in each.
- On a mobile-size browser, the list of books should appear in a single column.
- Each book entry in the list should contain the image, the title linked to the purchase URL, and the date published.
- Provide a sort toggle that will sort this data alphabetically by title or chronological by publish date.
- Provide functionality for at least one of the following (only modifies data in the browser, not backend storage). Adding all of the following is appreciated, but not required:
    - Add a book with an image
    - Delete a book
    - Modify a book

You may use whatever javascript/css/html libraries, tools and frameworks that you are most comfortable with. You may also use whatever server and build tools you prefer.

Please deliver the following items:

1. Your source code.

2. Build instructions. This should run on any webserver, but we will need to know if there are any tools or scripts needed to build your application.

3. Your built/compressed application files (Required), and a link to your running application if you are able to deploy it on a free service (Not Required).

4. Provide a short reason as to why you chose to build the application in your selected framework.

Your submission will be judged on the following:

- Requirements as stated above are all met
- Visual quality
- Code quality
- Application responsiveness
