# iOS Code Challenge

## Project Overview
The goal of the assignment is to build a simple app that lists posts on a home screen and shows a detail screen using SwiftUI.

A .json file continaing post content, as well as all additional necessary resources are provided in the project.

## Project Guidelines
- Use the Swift language with SwiftUI, not Objective-C or UIKit
- You can use your favorite Software Architecture Pattern(MVVM preferred)
- No 3rd party dependencies
- The project must be well structured/modeled
- Ensure the project builds properly before returning it
- Submit a zip file for review - do not submit a Pull Request

Please feel free to contact us if you have any additional questions!

- Create this screen with SwiftUI
- Try to replicate the example layout/borders as closely as possible
- Tapping a post item should go to the “Post Detail Screen”
- You can use any fonts you like
- The reply, share, and react widgets are not required to be functional
- Top search bar is optional
