# Data Engineer Interview

## Python Data Slice n' Dice Challenge (30-60 minutes)

### Description

This challenge involves munging a CSV of data to answer a few questions the product team has. You may do the exercise
in the language you are most comforatble with -- doing it in python or pandas gets bonus points!

### Questions to answer

1. For each row of the CSV, please convert the "genres" string into a list. Return a list of the rows, with the genres field modified. Return type List[List[String, Int, String, Int]]
2. What are all the unique genres of movies? Return type: List[String]
3. How many movies are there per genre? Return type:  Dict(String->Int)
4. Given a genre, return the list of movies from that genre. Return type: Dict(String->List[String])
5. For each year available, what are the top 5 grossing movies? Return both the movie name and the gross revenue for each result. Return type: Dict(Int -> Tuple(String, Int))
6. From the previous result, return the top 3 largest grossing movies (regardless of year). Return type: List[Tuple(String, Int)]
7. What are the top 10 biggest flops (i.e. movies that had the lowest revenue)? Return type: List[Tuple(String, Int)]
8. Of these 10 flops, what genres did they belong to? Return type: Dict[String->List[String]]
9. What was the year with the most flops? Return type: Int
10. What was the genre with the most flops? Return type: String
11. For each genre, What are the top 5 most common words used in the movie titles? Return type: dict(string->List[string]).

## SQL Analysis Challenge (30-60 minutes)

### Description

We are going to use the kaggle dataset about soccer to do some SQL analysis. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/version/1 or from the `data` directory as `soccer.zip`. You will need to unzip this database. It is about 300mb in size.

This is a sqlite database, which has its own quirks but is easily installable on most systems. You are allowed to google and test out as much as youâ€™d like (just share your screen so we can observe your problem solving process).

This is a series of questions designed to test your familiarity with SQL filtering, joining, and aggregations.  

#### A couple tips

You can use the `.schema ` or `.schema <tablename>` command in the sqlite console to see the schema for each sql table.

### Questions to answer

1. Tell me the name of the player who has the highest left-footed (`preferred_foot`), shot_power and free_kick_accuracy
2. Get me the roster (list of player names) for each team
3. BONUS: For each player that has been a member of more than 3 teams, tell me the player name, the team name, number of matches they have played for each team

#### Notes for the interviewer:

- Solutions for these queries are in the google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzdCnx9QKWl4bBd9M4H-pr7JUUJVL3OWbVvUQ6V9zoI/edit?usp=sharing

## API Server Project

### Description

Build an API server in any language of your choosing (you are allowed to use a web-app skeletons / templates created beforehand) that uses the National Data Buoy Center Dataset to compute the following:

- given a STATION_ID, we want to pull the last 45 days of historical data for that buoy and return the largest 4 recorded waves in that height
- Each wave should include the unique day/month/year of when it was recorded. Each day should only return the largest wave (i.e. only one value per day)
