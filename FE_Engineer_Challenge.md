The objective of this exercise is to build a small javascript-based web application using Angular 14+. You should approach this exercise with the same professionalism and attention to detail as you would for a request from a client.
The application should retrieve json-formatted data using the following endpoint:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/api-fun/books.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/api-fun/books.json)

The application requirements are as follows:

- Display the author's name, birthday and place of birth followed by a list of books.
- On a desktop view, the list of books should be displayed in two columns.
- On a mobile-size browser, the list of books should be displayed in a single column.
- Each book entry in the list should contain the image, the title linked to the purchase URL, and the date published.
- Provide a sort toggle that gives the user ability to sort data in two ways: alphabetically by title or chronological by publish date.
- All the below features are required (Implementing this action only needs to modify data in the browser, not the backend storage):
    - Add a book with an image
    - Delete a book
    - Modify a book

You may use whatever css/html UI libraries, tools that you are most comfortable with. You may also use whatever server and build tools you prefer.

Please deliver the following items:

1. Your source code.

2. Build instructions. This should run on any webserver, but we will need to know if there are any tools or scripts needed to build your application.

3. Your built/compressed application files (Required), and a link to your running application if you are able to deploy it on a free service (Not Required).

4. Provide a short reason as to why you chose to build the application in your selected framework.
